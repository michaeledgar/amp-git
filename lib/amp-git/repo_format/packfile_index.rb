        # Git uses it's "gc" command to pack loose objects into PackFiles.
        # This is one file, preferably with an index (though not requiring one),
        # which stores a number of objects in a very simple raw form.
        #
        # This class handles the index file, which is used for fast lookups of
        # entries in packfiles. They use fanouts to make searching very simple.
        #
        # The fanout values are interesting - they are the number of entries with a first sha1
        # byte less than or equal to the byte provided. So if the only sha1s you can
        # find in a given packfile are 00112233.... and 020304.... then the first few
        # fanouts are:
        # fanout[0] = 1
        # fanout[1] = 1
        # fanout[2] = 2
        # ....
